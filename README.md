# Shopify Nasa Spacestagram Challenge

My challenge project for the shopify remote front end developer position (2022).

Beautiful images from NASA infinitely scrolled. Sometimes the NASA APOD API is slow, so please give it a minute.

Live Demo at https://joshspagestagram.netlify.app/#/

### Getting Started Locally


First clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/joshxgchen/Spacestagram


Install necessary packages via:

npm i @shopify/polaris
npm i react-router-dom 5.20


This module runs on React v16. 
Set up a .env file in the root folder and add a NASA API Key:

REACT_APP_API_KEY= your api_key_value (as a string)

Start up the React app locally:

npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
